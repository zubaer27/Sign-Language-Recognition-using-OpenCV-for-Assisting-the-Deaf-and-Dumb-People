# Sign-Language-Recognition-using-OpenCV-for-Assisting-the-Deaf-and-Dumb-People
## Overview
We aim to develop a real-time sign language recognition system using OpenCV 
to translate gestures into text, bridging communication gaps and enhancing 
accessibility for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.

## Feature

- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** Captures and processes gestures from live video streams using OpenCV.
- **Translation to Text:** Converts recognized gestures into text.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Simple design for easy use without technical knowledge.
- **Customizable Gesture Database:** Add or update gestures for different sign languages.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** Handles image processing and hand gesture detection from video.
- **Machine Learning/Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes CNNs or pre-trained networks for accurate gesture classification.
- **PyFirmata:** A Python library for easy communication with Arduino using the Firmata protocol.
